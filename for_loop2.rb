#times each number can be divided evenly with the numbers 
#ranging from 1 to 25. A number x can be said to "divide evenly" by y,

#For example, in the range of 1 â€“ 1000, 
#there are 1,000 numbers that are evenly divided by the number 1. 
#There are 500 numbers in that range that divide evenly by 2, and so forth.
